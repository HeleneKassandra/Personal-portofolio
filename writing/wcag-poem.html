        <h1>WCAG Poem</h1>
        <p>
            To help you make, accessible designs.<br/>
            Use the WCAG guidelines.<br/><br/>
            
            Required by law, and might seem like a chore.<br/>
            But it's not something, you want to ignore.<br/><br/>
            
            It has three levels, with grades to be received.<br/>
            A is the lowest, but law abiding UI, is not achieved<br/><br/>
            
            Double A, is the one you should do.<br>
            Unless you can go higher, then good on you.<br/><br/>
            
            It's easy to achieve the level demanded.<br/>
            With right syntax on the HTML added.<br/><br/>
            
            Image tag, should have an 'alt' attribute<br/>
            To avoid creating a screenreader dispute.<br/><br/>
            
            Don't rely info, just through colour.<br/>
            And make it clear where you hover</br><br/>
            
            Users should not have to strive,<br/>
            Have colour contrast larger than 4.5<br/><br/>
            
            Resize the browser, and see how content align.<br/>
            It's one way to see if you got responsive design.<br/><br/>
            
            Help your users when they make a mistake.<br>
            Or your customer support, will never get a break.<br/><br/>
            
            Can everything be reached, through tab navigation?<br/>
            Then you're one step closer to a good application.<br/><br/>
            
            The newest version is WCAG 2.1<br/>
            And with that this rhyme is done.
