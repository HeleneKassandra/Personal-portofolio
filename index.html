            <p>
              I created a website for the gaming community I used to lead. The site was created in React, using sanity.io to update and store all the content, which was then fetched through their API.
              In addition to host a blog and basic information about the community, the site also fetch all the events from the calendar bot on Discord. Allowing admins to create events in Discord, and have it automatically
              show on the website. The site also messaged the right channel on Discord, whenever a potential member would request a in-game invitation by filling in their username.

              I took the initiative of creating a dictionary for searching up difficult terms and abbreviations used at Posten.
              The goal was to make it easier for myself and my co-workers to search up terms, that we might come across in documents etc.
              The site has been shared with different departments, and other people have contributed with their own words and explanations.
              Created in React.

                    Cypress.io is a tool for setting up, writing, running and debugging tests. Compared to many other testing tools, Cypress allow you see the state of your user-interface during different stages of interaction.
                    In this article I quickly go through the progress of getting started, writing and running your first tests, along with my personal opinion on why you should use Cypress.
